## Original User Request:
meditation. For that I will add information later. Then a bottom ribbon will have 4 buttons for faq, meditation instructions, about us, bot that answers meditation questions. The bot will be based on small LLM finetuned using qna dataset. I will do the finetuning later and Write tensor light package later. For now create a demo app with dummy data. At the top right should have Google log in button and an additional subscription button for payment.
